<p align="center">
  <em>Web Crawling and RAG Capabilities for AI Agents and AI Coding Assistants</em>
</p>

A powerful implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) integrated with [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for providing AI agents and AI coding assistants with advanced web crawling and RAG capabilities.

With this MCP server, you can <b>scrape anything</b> and then <b>use that knowledge anywhere</b> for RAG.

The primary goal is to bring this MCP server into [Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) as I evolve it to be more of a knowledge engine for AI coding assistants to build AI agents. This first version of the Crawl4AI/RAG MCP server will be improved upon greatly soon, especially making it more configurable so you can use different embedding models and run everything locally with Ollama.

## ðŸ†• New: Web UI and Enhanced Setup

This project now includes a **React web interface** and **database-based credential management** that makes it easier to:
- Configure and manage all settings through a web UI
- Start/stop the MCP server with a click
- Monitor crawling progress in real-time
- Search your knowledge base interactively
- Securely store API keys and configuration in the database

You can now get started with just your Supabase connection details - all other configuration can be done through the web interface!

## Overview

This MCP server provides tools that enable AI agents to crawl websites, store content in a vector database (Supabase), and perform RAG over the crawled content. It follows the best practices for building MCP servers based on the [Mem0 MCP server template](https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-mem0/) I provided on my channel previously.

The server includes several advanced RAG strategies that can be enabled to enhance retrieval quality:
- **Contextual Embeddings** for enriched semantic understanding
- **Hybrid Search** combining vector and keyword search
- **Agentic RAG** for specialized code example extraction
- **Reranking** for improved result relevance using cross-encoder models

See the [Configuration section](#configuration) below for details on how to enable and configure these strategies.

## Vision

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server is just the beginning. Here's where we're headed:

1. **Integration with Archon**: Building this system directly into [Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) to create a comprehensive knowledge engine for AI coding assistants to build better AI agents.

2. **Multiple Embedding Models**: Expanding beyond OpenAI to support a variety of embedding models, including the ability to run everything locally with Ollama for complete control and privacy.

3. **Advanced RAG Strategies**: Implementing sophisticated retrieval techniques like contextual retrieval, late chunking, and others to move beyond basic "naive lookups" and significantly enhance the power and precision of the RAG system, especially as it integrates with Archon.

4. **Enhanced Chunking Strategy**: Implementing a Context 7-inspired chunking approach that focuses on examples and creates distinct, semantically meaningful sections for each chunk, improving retrieval precision.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Increasing crawling and indexing speed to make it more realistic to "quickly" index new documentation to then leverage it within the same prompt in an AI coding assistant.

## Features

- **Smart URL Detection**: Automatically detects and handles different URL types (regular webpages, sitemaps, text files)
- **Recursive Crawling**: Follows internal links to discover content
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently crawls multiple pages simultaneously
- **Content Chunking**: Intelligently splits content by headers and size for better processing
- **Vector Search**: Performs RAG over crawled content, optionally filtering by data source for precision
- **Source Retrieval**: Retrieve sources available for filtering to guide the RAG process

## Tools

The server provides essential web crawling and search tools:

### Core Tools (Always Available)

1. **`crawl_single_page`**: Quickly crawl a single web page and store its content in the vector database
2. **`smart_crawl_url`**: Intelligently crawl a full website based on the type of URL provided (sitemap, llms-full.txt, or a regular webpage that needs to be crawled recursively)
3. **`get_available_sources`**: Get a list of all available sources (domains) in the database
4. **`perform_rag_query`**: Search for relevant content using semantic search with optional source filtering

### Conditional Tools

5. **`search_code_examples`** (requires `USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true`): Search specifically for code examples and their summaries from crawled documentation. This tool provides targeted code snippet retrieval for AI coding assistants.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker/Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if running the MCP server as a container (recommended)
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if running the MCP server directly through uv
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) if using the web UI
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (database for RAG)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (for generating embeddings)

## Installation

### Option 1: Quick Start with Web UI (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the integrated web UI with the startup script:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   ```

2. Create a minimal `.env` file with just your Supabase connection:
   ```bash
   cp .env-doc.md .env
   # Edit .env to add only:
   # SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   # SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
   ```

3. Run the startup script:
   ```bash
   ./startup.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Check your environment setup
   - Install all dependencies
   - Guide you through database setup
   - Start both the backend API and web UI
   - Launch the web interface at http://localhost:3000

4. Configure everything else through the Settings page in the web UI!

### Option 2: Using Docker Compose (Full Stack)

1. Clone this repository and set up minimal `.env`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   cp .env-doc.md .env
   # Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
   ```

2. Start the full stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This starts:
   - Backend API at http://localhost:8080
   - Web UI at http://localhost:3000
   - API documentation at http://localhost:8080/docs

### Option 3: Traditional MCP Server Setup

If you prefer to use the MCP server directly without the UI:

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t mcp/crawl4ai-rag --build-arg PORT=8051 .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the configuration section below

### Using uv directly (no Docker)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   ```

2. Install uv if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # on Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   crawl4ai-setup
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file based on the configuration section below

## Database Setup

Before running the server, you need to set up the database:

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard (create a new project first if necessary)

2. **For Web UI setup**: Run BOTH SQL files:
   - First run `credentials_setup.sql` to create the credentials table
   - Then run `crawled_pages.sql` to create the vector database tables

3. **For traditional setup**: Just run `crawled_pages.sql`

## Configuration

### Configuration with Web UI (Recommended)

When using the web UI, you only need minimal environment variables:

```bash
# .env file - minimal setup
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key

# Optional overrides
HOST=localhost
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

All other settings (API keys, model choices, RAG strategies) are configured through the Settings page in the web UI and stored securely in the database with encryption for sensitive values.

### Traditional Configuration (Direct MCP Server)

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# MCP Server Configuration
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8051
TRANSPORT=sse

# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# LLM for summaries and contextual embeddings
MODEL_CHOICE=gpt-4.1-nano

# RAG Strategies (set to "true" or "false", default to "false")
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=false
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=false

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

### RAG Strategy Options

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server supports four powerful RAG strategies that can be enabled independently:

#### 1. **USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS**
When enabled, this strategy enhances each chunk's embedding with additional context from the entire document. The system passes both the full document and the specific chunk to an LLM (configured via `MODEL_CHOICE`) to generate enriched context that gets embedded alongside the chunk content.

- **When to use**: Enable this when you need high-precision retrieval where context matters, such as technical documentation where terms might have different meanings in different sections.
- **Trade-offs**: Slower indexing due to LLM calls for each chunk, but significantly better retrieval accuracy.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls during indexing.

#### 2. **USE_HYBRID_SEARCH**
Combines traditional keyword search with semantic vector search to provide more comprehensive results. The system performs both searches in parallel and intelligently merges results, prioritizing documents that appear in both result sets.

- **When to use**: Enable this when users might search using specific technical terms, function names, or when exact keyword matches are important alongside semantic understanding.
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower search queries but more robust results, especially for technical content.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs, just computational overhead.

#### 3. **USE_AGENTIC_RAG**
Enables specialized code example extraction and storage. When crawling documentation, the system identifies code blocks (â‰¥300 characters), extracts them with surrounding context, generates summaries, and stores them in a separate vector database table specifically designed for code search.

- **When to use**: Essential for AI coding assistants that need to find specific code examples, implementation patterns, or usage examples from documentation.
- **Trade-offs**: Significantly slower crawling due to code extraction and summarization, requires more storage space.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls for summarizing each code example.
- **Benefits**: Provides a dedicated `search_code_examples` tool that AI agents can use to find specific code implementations.

#### 4. **USE_RERANKING**
Applies cross-encoder reranking to search results after initial retrieval. Uses a lightweight cross-encoder model (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) to score each result against the original query, then reorders results by relevance.

- **When to use**: Enable this when search precision is critical and you need the most relevant results at the top. Particularly useful for complex queries where semantic similarity alone might not capture query intent.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds ~100-200ms to search queries depending on result count, but significantly improves result ordering.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs - uses a local model that runs on CPU.
- **Benefits**: Better result relevance, especially for complex queries. Works with both regular RAG search and code example search.

### Recommended Configurations

**For general documentation RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=true
```

**For AI coding assistant with code examples:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=true
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true
USE_RERANKING=true
```

**For fast, basic RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=false
```

## Running the Server

### With Web UI

```bash
# Quick start
./startup.py

# Or using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the web UI at http://localhost:3000 to:
- Start/stop the MCP server
- Configure all settings
- Initiate crawling operations
- Search your knowledge base
- Monitor server logs

### Traditional MCP Server

### Using Docker

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8051:8051 mcp/crawl4ai-rag
```

### Using Python

```bash
uv run src/crawl4ai_mcp.py
```

The server will start and listen on the configured host and port.

## Integration with MCP Clients

The MCP server can still be integrated directly with MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc., even when using the web UI setup. The server runs on port 8051 by default.

### SSE Configuration

Once you have the server running with SSE transport, you can connect to it using this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note for Windsurf users**: Use `serverUrl` instead of `url` in your configuration:
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "crawl4ai-rag": {
>       "transport": "sse",
>       "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> **Note for Docker users**: Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` if your client is running in a different container. This will apply if you are using this MCP server within n8n!

### Stdio Configuration

Add this server to your MCP configuration for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/crawl4ai-mcp/src/crawl4ai_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "your_supabase_url",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "your_supabase_service_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker with Stdio Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", 
               "-e", "TRANSPORT", 
               "-e", "OPENAI_API_KEY", 
               "-e", "SUPABASE_URL", 
               "-e", "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY", 
               "mcp/crawl4ai"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "your_supabase_url",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "your_supabase_service_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building Your Own Server

This implementation provides a foundation for building more complex MCP servers with web crawling capabilities. To build your own:

1. Add your own tools by creating methods with the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
2. Create your own lifespan function to add your own dependencies
3. Modify the `utils.py` file for any helper functions you need
4. Extend the crawling capabilities by adding more specialized crawlers
