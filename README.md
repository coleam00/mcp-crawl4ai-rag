<h1 align="center">Crawl4AI RAG MCP Server</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>Web Crawling and RAG Capabilities for AI Agents and AI Coding Assistants</em>
</p>

A powerful implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) integrated with [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for providing AI agents and AI coding assistants with advanced web crawling and RAG capabilities.

With this MCP server, you can <b>scrape anything</b> and then <b>use that knowledge anywhere</b> for RAG.

The server includes several advanced RAG strategies that can be enabled to enhance retrieval quality:
- **Contextual Embeddings** for enriched semantic understanding
- **Hybrid Search** combining vector and keyword search
- **Agentic RAG** for specialized code example extraction
- **Reranking** for improved result relevance using cross-encoder models

See the [Configuration section](#configuration) below for details on how to enable and configure these strategies.

## Features

- **Smart URL Detection**: Automatically detects and handles different URL types (regular webpages, sitemaps, text files)
- **Recursive Crawling**: Follows internal links to discover content
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently crawls multiple pages simultaneously
- **Content Chunking**: Intelligently splits content by headers and size for better processing
- **Vector Search**: Performs RAG over crawled content, optionally filtering by data source for precision
- **Source Retrieval**: Retrieve sources available for filtering to guide the RAG process

## Tools

The server provides essential web crawling and search tools:
r
### Core Tools (Always Available)fssss
1. **`crawl_single_page`**: Quickly crawl a single web page and store its content in the vector database
2. **`smart_crawl_url`**: Intelligently crawl a full website based on the type of URL provided (sitemap, llms-full.txt, or a regular webpage that needs to be crawled recursively)
3. **`get_available_sources`**: Get a list of all available sources (domains) in the database
4. **`perform_rag_query`**: Search for relevant content using semantic search with optional source filtering

### Conditional Tools

5. **`search_code_examples`** (requires `USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true`): Search specifically for code examples and their summaries from crawled documentation. This tool provides targeted code snippet retrieval for AI coding assistants.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker/Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if running the MCP server as a container (recommended)
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if running the MCP server directly through uv
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (database for RAG)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (for generating embeddings)

   docker build -t mcp/crawl4ai-rag --build-arg PORT=8051 .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the configuration section below

### Using uv directly (no Docker)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   ```

2. Install uv if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # on Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   crawl4ai-setup
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file based on the configuration section below

## Database Setup

Before running the server, you need to set up the database with the pgvector extension:

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard (create a new project first if necessary)

2. Create a new query and paste the contents of `crawled_pages.sql`

3. Run the query to create the necessary tables and functions

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# MCP Server Configuration
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8051
TRANSPORT=sse

# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# LLM for summaries and contextual embeddings
MODEL_CHOICE=gpt-4.1-nano

# OpenRouter Configuration (optional - set USE_OPENROUTER=true to enable)
USE_OPENROUTER=false
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key

# RAG Strategies (set to "true" or "false", default to "false")
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=false
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=false
USE_QUERY_EXPANSION=false
USE_OVERLAPPING_CHUNKS=false

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

### LLM Provider Options

The server supports both OpenAI and OpenRouter for LLM operations (contextual embeddings, code summaries, and source summaries):

- **OpenAI** (default): Uses OpenAI's API directly. Set `MODEL_CHOICE` to any OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`).

- **OpenRouter**: Access a wide variety of models through OpenRouter's unified API. To use OpenRouter:
  1. Set `USE_OPENROUTER=true`
  2. Provide your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  3. Set `MODEL_CHOICE` to any model available on OpenRouter (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-opus`, `google/gemini-pro`, `meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct`)

**Note**: OpenRouter is only used for LLM operations. Embeddings always use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model for consistency.

### RAG Strategy Options

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server supports six powerful RAG strategies that can be enabled independently:

#### 1. **USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS**
When enabled, this strategy enhances each chunk's embedding with additional context from the entire document. The system passes both the full document and the specific chunk to an LLM (configured via `MODEL_CHOICE`) to generate enriched context that gets embedded alongside the chunk content.

- **When to use**: Enable this when you need high-precision retrieval where context matters, such as technical documentation where terms might have different meanings in different sections.
- **Trade-offs**: Slower indexing due to LLM calls for each chunk, but significantly better retrieval accuracy.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls during indexing.

#### 2. **USE_HYBRID_SEARCH**
Combines traditional keyword search with semantic vector search to provide more comprehensive results. The system performs both searches in parallel and intelligently merges results, prioritizing documents that appear in both result sets.

- **When to use**: Enable this when users might search using specific technical terms, function names, or when exact keyword matches are important alongside semantic understanding.
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower search queries but more robust results, especially for technical content.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs, just computational overhead.

#### 3. **USE_AGENTIC_RAG**
Enables specialized code example extraction and storage. When crawling documentation, the system identifies code blocks (â‰¥300 characters), extracts them with surrounding context, generates summaries, and stores them in a separate vector database table specifically designed for code search.

- **When to use**: Essential for AI coding assistants that need to find specific code examples, implementation patterns, or usage examples from documentation.
- **Trade-offs**: Significantly slower crawling due to code extraction and summarization, requires more storage space.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls for summarizing each code example.
- **Benefits**: Provides a dedicated `search_code_examples` tool that AI agents can use to find specific code implementations.

#### 4. **USE_RERANKING**
Applies cross-encoder reranking to search results after initial retrieval. Uses a lightweight cross-encoder model (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) to score each result against the original query, then reorders results by relevance.

- **When to use**: Enable this when search precision is critical and you need the most relevant results at the top. Particularly useful for complex queries where semantic similarity alone might not capture query intent.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds ~100-200ms to search queries depending on result count, but significantly improves result ordering.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs - uses a local model that runs on CPU.
- **Benefits**: Better result relevance, especially for complex queries. Works with both regular RAG search and code example search.

#### 5. **USE_QUERY_EXPANSION**
Automatically expands user queries with synonyms, related terms, and variations to improve retrieval recall. The system uses an LLM to generate expanded queries that capture different ways the same concept might be expressed in documentation.

- **When to use**: Enable this when users might not know the exact terminology used in documentation, or when dealing with diverse documentation that uses different terms for similar concepts.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a small latency to queries due to the LLM call, but significantly improves recall by finding relevant documents that might use different terminology.
- **Cost**: One additional LLM API call per search query.
- **Benefits**: Better coverage of relevant documents, especially helpful for beginners who might not know specific technical terms.

#### 6. **USE_OVERLAPPING_CHUNKS**
Creates document chunks with configurable overlap to preserve context at chunk boundaries. By default, uses 10% overlap between consecutive chunks, ensuring that information at chunk boundaries isn't lost during retrieval.

- **When to use**: Enable this when dealing with documents where important information might span chunk boundaries, such as technical documentation with multi-paragraph explanations or code examples with surrounding context.
- **Trade-offs**: Increases the number of chunks stored (roughly 10-15% more), which means slightly higher storage costs and potentially more results to process.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs, just increased storage usage.
- **Benefits**: Better context preservation, reduced risk of missing relevant information that spans chunk boundaries, improved retrieval for complex topics.

### Recommended Configurations

**For general documentation RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false

```

## Running the Server

### Using Docker

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8051:8051 mcp/crawl4ai-rag
```

### Using Python

```bash
uv run src/crawl4ai_mcp.py
```

The server will start and listen on the configured host and port.

## Integration with MCP Clients

### SSE Configuration

Once you have the server running with SSE transport, you can connect to it using this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note for Windsurf users**: Use `serverUrl` instead of `url` in your configuration:
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "crawl4ai-rag": {
>       "transport": "sse",
>       "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> **Note for Docker users**: Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` if your client is running in a different container. This will apply if you are using this MCP server within n8n!

### Stdio Configuration

Add this server to your MCP configuration for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/crawl4ai-mcp/src/crawl4ai_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "your_supabase_url",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "your_supabase_service_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker with Stdio Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", 
               "-e", "TRANSPORT", 
               "-e", "OPENAI_API_KEY", 
               "-e", "SUPABASE_URL", 
               "-e", "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY", 
               "mcp/crawl4ai"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "your_supabase_url",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "your_supabase_service_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building Your Own Server

This implementation provides a foundation for building more complex MCP servers with web crawling capabilities. To build your own:

1. Add your own tools by creating methods with the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
2. Create your own lifespan function to add your own dependencies
3. Modify the `utils.py` file for any helper functions you need
4. Extend the crawling capabilities by adding more specialized crawlers
